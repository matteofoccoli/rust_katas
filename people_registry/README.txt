Kata inspired by https://www.codewars.com/kata/5ba575f239d1afa14c000052

In this kata you will train your skills in:

static functions
read/write to/from file
using classes for storing files information
The idea: You want to learn how to read information from file, write this information to file and how to use classes to help you.

The task: Your task is to complete class Person and class Worker and implement all missing functions.

Explanations: You have some .txt file (“people.txt”), where information about persons is stored. One person is stored in one line. Where "Oliver;m;23;" means we have person with name "Oliver", he is a man ('m'), 23 years old. Or "Isabella;w;27;" means we have person with name "Isabella", she is a woman ('w'), 27 years old.

Class Person stores information about person (or a line, that is stored per person in a "people.txt") Class Worker is used for reading (readItems()), saving (writeAllItems()) persons in some file or used for showing (showItems) persons from a vector with Persons. writeSplitedItems() is used for saving persons separated by gender (see details in the initial solution). Note. Try to implement classes step by step, going test by test. Have fun and don't forget to select how you are satisfied with this kata and/or leave your proposals or comments.
